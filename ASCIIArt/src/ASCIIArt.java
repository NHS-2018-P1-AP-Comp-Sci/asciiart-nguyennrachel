/**
 * Unit 1 Project
 * 
 * In this project you have the opportunity to create a piece of artwork using
 * ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange). Using the already
 * created file named `ASCIIArt.java` write a program that outputs your artwork
 * to the console. The goal of this project is to use ONLY what we have learned
 * in Unit 1 to create anything you would like so be creative (and school
 * appropriate). Artwork must also have a caption describing what it's
 * depicting.
 * 
 * For those of you who have dabbled in coding before, try to contain your code
 * to just what we have discussed in this unit.
 *
